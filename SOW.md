## Project Title:
CS457 Online Multiplayer Connect 4

## Team:
Mark Richards

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a functional game of connect 4 that two players can play online through client-server architecture and socket programming.

## Scope:
### Inclusions:
Sockets to allow two clients to connect to a server.
## Deliverables:
- **server.py:** Server script to run connect clients and run game.
- **client.py:** Client script to allow two clients to connect to a server to play.
- The result should be a fully functional game of Connect 4 that two players can connect to and play.
